# Dogs_Vs_Cats_Classification
Creating model for classification of dogs and cats images.


Cats vs Dogs classification is a fundamental Deep Learning project for learning deep learning. 
Here I will use TensorFlow and Keras to build Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture 
which can be predicted with more than 90 % accuracy in a balanced data which image is a cat which
is a dog (binary classification). 

Data sets are available in kaggle.
