# Dogs_Vs_Cats_Classification

Creating a model for the classification of dog and cat images.

Cats vs Dogs classification is an exciting project for learning deep learning. Here TensorFlow and Keras were used to build Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images belonging to dogs and cats. The model reached more than 90 % accuracy in a balanced data set in this binary classification task.

Data sets are available on Kaggle.
